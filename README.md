# YouTube-shorts-automation
This project automates the entire process of creating a distracting YouTube short video about facts.

1) This is a program that automates the whole process of creating a youtube short.
2) It has a background video of some distracting gameplay to make the video engaging.
3) The facts displayed and read out (using gTTS) is obtained using the chatgpt api.
4) Background music is AI generated music. 
5) Captions are auto generated as well by predicting when the words must be displayed by undertanding the speech speed (number of words per minute) of gTTS, except in exceptional cases where a different program uses a software made to create accurate captions.
6) Pictures related to the fact are displayed from the internet (automatic process).
